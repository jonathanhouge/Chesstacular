/**
 * This package holds all the different types of pieces that are used in a game
 * of chess, specifically: King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Pawn, and Rook. It bases
 * these pieces on an abstract class Piece, which holds the general
 * functionality of the specific pieces while the subclasses implement the piece
 * specific traits, such as determining if a piece's movement to a specific
 * coordinate is valid or not.
